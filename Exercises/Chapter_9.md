# Chapter 9 Exercises
#### 9.1 Under what circumstances do page faults occur? Describe the actions taken by the operating system when a page fault occurs.

Page fault occur when page of process is not in memory for CPU to access. 


#### 9.2 Assume that you have a page-reference string for a process with m frames (initially all empty). The page-reference string has length p, and n distinct page numbers occur in it. Answer these questions for any page-replacement algorithms:
    a. What is a lower bound on the number of page faults?
    b. What is an upper bound on the number of page faults?

#### 9.3 Consider the page table shown in Figure 9.30 for a system with 12-bit virtual and physical addresses and with 256-byte pages. The list of free page frames is D, E, F (that is, D is at the head of the list, E is second, and F is last).
Convert the following virtual addresses to their equivalent physical addresses in hexadecimal. All numbers are given in hexadecimal. (A dash for a page frame indicates that the page is not in memory.)
