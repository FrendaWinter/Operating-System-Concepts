# Concept:

- Operating systems exist because they offer a reasonable way to solve the problem of creating a usable computing system. 
The fundamental goal of computer systems is to execute programs and to make solving user problems easier. Computer hardware is constructed toward this goal. Since bare hardware alone is not particularly easy to use, application programs are developed. These programs require certain common operations, such as those controlling the I/O devices. The common functions of controlling and allocating resources are then brought together into one piece of software: the operating system.


- System bus:
  - Address bus
  - Control bus
  - Data bus

- Interrupts:


DEFINITIONS OF COMPUTER SYSTEM COMPONENTS
- CPU— The hardware that executes instructions.
- Processor —A physical chip that contains one or more CPUs.
- Core— The basic computation unit of the CPU.
- Multicore —Including multiple computing cores on the same CPU.
- Multiprocessor — Including multiple processors.

Although virtually all systems are now multicore, we use the general term
CPU when referring to a single computational unit of a computer system and
core as well as multicore when specifically referring to one or more cores on
a CPU.
